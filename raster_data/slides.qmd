# From geometries to rasters

---

### Some data are not linked to geometries
### Some data are linked to cells of a grid {.fragment .fade-in}

---

### Grid can be represented as geometries
### But it is inefficient! {.fragment .fade-in}

# Welcome N-D arrays

---

#### Efficient storage
#### Efficient processing (grids are predictable!) {.fragment .fade-in}
#### Efficient scaling {.fragment .fade-in}
#### Efficient data structure for N-dimensional data {.fragment .fade-in}

---

### Directly reflect the way some data is captured

# Grids in social geography

---

### Usually large (global) scale data
