:::::{.question}
**Which of the following best describes the difference between a linear and non-linear model in machine learning??**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
A linear model assumes a direct proportionality between the input and output variables, while a non-linear model does not.
:::

:::{.choice}
Linear models are more accurate than non-linear models in all cases.
:::

:::{.choice}
Non-linear models always involve more complex mathematical calculations than linear models.
:::

:::{.choice}
A non-linear model cannot be used for regression problems.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**What is the purpose of splitting a dataset into training and testing sets?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
To avoid overfitting by using different data for model training and evaluation.
:::

:::{.choice}
To ensure that the model sees all the data at least once.
:::

:::{.choice}
To reduce the size of the dataset to make the model run faster.
:::

:::{.choice}
To increase the accuracy of the predictions by using smaller datasets.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**Which of the following steps is performed immediately after training a machine learning model?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
Splitting the dataset.
:::

:::{.choice}
Evaluating the model using the test set.
:::

:::{.choice}
Fine-tuning the model.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Predicting on unseen data.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**If a regression model has an R² score of 0.85, what does this indicate about the model's performance?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
The model has an error rate of 85%.
:::

:::{.choice}
The model is overfitting the training data.
:::

:::{.choice}
The model's predictions are accurate by 85% on average.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
The model explains 85% of the variance in the target variable.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**Which of the following evaluation metrics penalizes large prediction errors more heavily?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
:::

:::{.choice}
R-squared (R²)
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
:::

:::{.choice}
None of the above
:::

:::::

:::::{.question}
**What is the main benefit of using cross-validation over a simple train-test split?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
Cross-validation ensures that the model will be 100% accurate.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Cross-validation helps to better estimate model performance by using multiple training-test splits.
:::

:::{.choice}
Cross-validation makes the training process faster.
:::

:::{.choice}
Cross-validation can only be used for linear models.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**What is the main reason for computing spatially stratified metrics in model evaluation?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
To get global evaluation scores for the entire dataset.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
To account for regional differences and compute performance metrics for each geographical subset.
:::

:::{.choice}
To increase the accuracy of the model's predictions.
:::

:::{.choice}
To ensure that the model is overfitting.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**What does the term "spatial leakage" refer to in spatial cross-validation?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
The leakage of information between temporal datasets.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
When spatial proximity between training and test sets violates the assumption of independence.
:::

:::{.choice}
The leakage of features from test data into the training data.
:::

:::{.choice}
The violation of model performance evaluation due to overfitting.
:::

::::
:::::

:::::{.question}
**In a Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis, what does a "High-High" cluster of residuals indicate?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
A region with consistently high error rates.
:::

:::{.choice}
A region with over-predicted values.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
A region where the model consistently under-predicts.
:::

:::{.choice}
A region with low error rates.
:::

::::
:::::

The accuracy of each feature’s predictions.
:::

:::{.choice}
The raw coefficients assigned to each feature.
:::
