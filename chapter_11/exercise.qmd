## Continue with classficiation

- try combining multiple approaches. Can you get Kappa over 0.6?
- what if you used different ML models than RandomForest? Compare the same input using different models, like HistGradientBoostingClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, or AdaBoostClassifier. Which one is the best, when using the default hyperparameters?
- find clusters of areas with high and low certainty

## Explore regression

- try to use techniques of spatial augmentation on the regression model predicting price
    - what is the best R2 you can get?

## Effect of hyperparameters (advanced)

- You've been using the default model parameters. Can you figure out a way of fine-tuning them? Have a look at this [resource](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html) and try to fine-tune on of the models you've worked with. -->
