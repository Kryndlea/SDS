This course material is currently under construction and is likely incomplete. The final
version will be released in October 2023.

This will be a course on Spatial Data Science for Social Geography.

The course will be taught in person at Charles University in Prague from October 2023.

More information will be shared closer to the starting date.

## Aims

TBD

## Is it only for social geography?

The course revolves around data typically used in social geography but its applicability
is by no means limited to social geography. In practice, you will work more with vector
data than rasters (although we cover those a bit as well) and often with data capturing
various aspects of human life. The spatial data science concepts, however, are universal.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes an understanding of geography and its key concepts (e.g. coordinate
reference systems or the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem [@openshaw1983modifiable]), at
least basic familiarity with GIS (like file formats and basic spatial data manipulation)
and a basic understanding of statistics (e.g. understanding the concept of regression),
optimally with some spatial component (geographically weighted regression). While
the course will briefly explain these topics, it will not cover the theory and
statistics behind these concepts in detail.

No prior experience with programming or computer science is needed, although a positive
attitude towards these topics is necessary.

## Course structure

The material is planned for 12 weeks with one session per week. Each session
is divided into three parts - _Concepts_, _Hands-on_ and _Exercise_, following the model
proposed by @darribas_gds_course. _Concepts_ have a form of a lecture covering conceptual
aspects of the topic of the day, providing necessary theoretical background before digging into code. This part can be nicknamed ["I do"]{.accent}.
_Hands-on_ contains documented code in a form of a Jupyter notebook which is executed in
parallel by a lecturer, providing an additional explanation, and by students. Therefore, we have a part ["We do"]{.accent}.
_Exercise_ is a set of tasks that are to be performed by students individually, with an
occasional guidance by the lecturer. So we finish the day with ["You do"]{.accent}.

For enrolled students of Charles University, the course will finish with a written
assignment in a form of a computational essay. See the
[Assignment](chapter_00/assignment.qmd) section for details.

## Literature

The course loosely follows the contents of the **Geographic Data Science with Python**
by @rey2023geographic. The online version of the book is available under open access
from [geographicdata.science/book](https://geographicdata.science/book). It is
recommended to use the online version over the printed one, although this is entirely up
to you.
