:::::{.question}
**What is a graph in PySAL used for?**

::::{.choices .correct-choice}

:::{.choice}
It is a structure where nodes represent spatial units, and edges represent spatial relationships.

:::::{.question}
**What is the difference between Queen, Rook, and Bishop contiguity?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
Queen and Rook both consider only shared edges, while Bishop considers both edges and vertices.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Queen considers neighbors that share edges and vertices, Rook considers only shared edges, Bishop considers shared vertices only.
:::

:::{.choice}
Queen considers shared edges, Rook shared vertices, and Bishop considers diagonal neighbors.
:::

:::{.choice}
Queen considers only shared vertices, Rook considers both edges and vertices, and Bishop considers shared distances.
:::

:::::{.question}
**How do k-nearest neighbor (KNN) spatial weights differ from contiguity-based methods?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
KNN considers only neighboring regions with shared boundaries.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
KNN connects an observation to a fixed number of closest neighbors.
:::

:::{.choice}
KNN uses a binary approach for weighting.
:::

:::{.choice}
KNN focuses only on Euclidean distance in geographic space.
:::

:::::{.question}
**Which of the following statements best describes block weights and how they differ from distance and contiguity weights?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
Block weights assign a weight of one to neighboring observations based on their physical distance, while distance weights assign weights according to geographical proximity.
:::

:::{.choice}
Block weights define spatial connections through shared boundaries, similar to contiguity weights, making them suitable for polygon analysis.
:::

:::{.choice}
Block weights utilize a continuous scale for weights, whereas distance weights only consider categorical group memberships.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Block weights connect observations in the same category with a weight of one, regardless of distance, while distance weights assign weights based on how far apart observations are.
:::

:::::{.question}
**What is the key difference between perimeter-weighted contiguity and a distance-weighted distance band?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
Perimeter-weighted contiguity assigns weights based on the shared perimeter length between neighboring units, while a distance-weighted distance band assigns weights that decrease as the distance between units increases.
:::

:::{.choice}
Perimeter-weighted contiguity uses the Euclidean distance between spatial units, while a distance-weighted distance band considers the Manhattan distance.:::

:::{.choice}
Perimeter-weighted contiguity calculates weights based on distance decay functions, while a distance-weighted distance band calculates weights based on the area of each unit.
:::

:::{.choice}
Perimeter-weighted contiguity only works for irregular polygons, while a distance-weighted distance band applies only to regular grids.

:::::{.question}
**What does the function `queen.to_parquet("queen.parquet")` do in PySAL?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
It converts a spatial weights object into a queen contiguity matrix and displays it.
:::

:::{.choice}
It exports a queen contiguity matrix to a CSV file format for analysis.
:::

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
It saves a queen contiguity weights object as a compressed Parquet file for efficient storage.
:::

:::{.choice}
t converts a spatial weights object into a shapefile for geographic data visualization.
:::

:::::

:::::{.question}
**What is a spatial lag in the context of spatial analysis?**

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
The influence of neighboring observations on the value of a variable at a given location.
:::

:::{.choice  .correct-choice}
The weighted average of a variable in neighboring observations.
:::

:::{.choice}
The total distance between all observations and their neighbors.
:::

:::{.choice}
The time it takes for spatial relationships to manifest.
