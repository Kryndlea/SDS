This course is assessed based on a single final assignment - a computational essay.

# Office hours

Students enrolled in `MZ340V17` can book a slot to discuss the assignment via [cal.com/martinfleis/sds](https://cal.com/martinfleis/sds). The slots are available two weeks ahead and must be booked at least a day in advance.

## Computational essay

A computational essay is an essay whose narrative is supported by code and its results,
which are part of the essay. Think of a Jupyter Notebook with cells corresponding to
text explaining the process and its results and cells with executed code doing the
computation.

# An example of a computational essay

One nice example of a computational essay is the
[Age Capsule](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/age_capsule/) by Dani Arribas-Bel. The code in
there is a bit more advanced than what you are asked to do and you will need to include
some maps and possibly tables, but you get the gist.
:::

The essay corresponds to a range of 2,500-5,000 words. That does not mean that you have
to write that many words. Since you will have to produce not only text (in English or
Czech) but also code and its outputs, the following requirements are specified:

- The approximate number of words in Markdown cells is 1,500 (the bibliography, if provided,
  does not count towards the word count). Try to stay within 20% margin.
- The approximate number of maps or other graphic outputs is 5 (one output may contain more than one map
  and will only count as one, but it must be included in the same `matplotlib` object).
- The approximate number of tables is 2, where a table is considered an output
  of a DataFrame automatically rendered by the Notebook.

The rest of the word count is assumed to be consumed by code.

You have two options regarding topics. The first one is to work on your data on the
topic of your choice, while the second is a semi-defined task if you prefer that.

### Define your task

Option one is to come up with your own idea for an essay, supported by data you either
already have or can gather from openly available sources.

The requirement is to cover:

1. Initial data exploration and visualisation[^1]
2. Exploration of a degree of randomness of data (e.g. spatial autocorrelation, point pattern analysis)[^2]
3. At least one other technique of your choice (clustering, interpolation, regression, prediction)[^3]

[^1]: Based on sessions [Introduction](../introduction/hands_on.qmd) - [Spatial data](../geographic_data/hands_on.qmd).
[^2]: Based on sessions [Spatial weights](../spatial_graphs/hands_on.qmd) - [Point patterns](../point_patterns/hands_on.qmd).
[^3]: Based on sessions [Clustering](../clustering/hands_on.qmd) - [Machine learning](../classification/hands_on.qmd).

Consult the second option to get a better sense of the extent.

::: {.callout-important}
# Every topic needs to be approved

If you decide to define your own task, the topic and the extent need to be approved by
the tutor. Essays on custom topics without prior approval will not be accepted and will
be marked with 0%. Reach out via Discord or email to get approval.
:::

This option is recommended for students of Master's and Postgraduate courses enrolled in
`MZ340V17`.

The second option is more defined but still leaves some space for your creativity.

### A Barcelona case

You will take the role of a real-world data scientist tasked to explore a dataset on the
city of Barcelona (Spain) and find useful insights for a variety of decision-makers. It
does not matter if you have never been to Barcelona. In fact, this will help you focus on
what you can learn about the city through the data, without the influence of prior
knowledge. Furthermore, the assessment will not be marked based on how much you know
about Barcelona but instead on how much you can show you have learned through analysing
data.

#### Part one

In the first part, you are asked to provide an overview of the socio-economic structure of
Barcelona.

##### Data

Head to the [Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset)
data service of Barcelona's City Hall and download data reflecting two aspects (two
variables) of the population structure of the city at the level of census areas (_Secci√≥
censal_ in Spanish), find relevant geometry, and link them together.

1. Explore the spatial distribution of the data using choropleths. Comment on the
   details of your maps and interpret the results.
2. Explore the degree of spatial autocorrelation. Describe the concepts behind your
   approach and interpret your results.

#### Part two

For this one, you need to pick _one_ of the following three options.

1. Create a classification (clustering) of Barcelona based on your socioeconomic data
   and interpret the results. In the process, answer the following questions:
    - What are the main types of neighbourhoods you identify?
    - Which characteristics help you delineate this typology?
    - If you had to use this classification to target areas in most need, how would you
      use it? Why?
    - How is the city partitioned by your data?

The other two options share the basics:

- Download listings for Barcelona from
  [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). You have already used Airbnb
  data before in the course, so you can refer to the code used there.
- Barcelona is known for its issue with Airbnb density. Visualise the data appropriately
  and discuss why you have taken your specific approach.

2. Asses the distribution of Airbnbs in Barcelona
    - Are the Airbnb listings distributed equally across the city? Does it depend on the
      type of listing or its price?
    - Can you create a regionalisation of Barcelona census areas based on the presence
      of Airbnbs? What does it say about the city?

3. Asses the relationship between the socio-economic profile of Barcelona and the
   presence of Airbnb.
    - Use regression techniques to asses a link between the socio-economic data from
      part one and the variable of your choice from the Airbnb dataset. Think of a
      density of listings or an average price.
    - Discuss the implications of the results. What does it mean for policy?

## Submission

The submission will contain an executed Jupyter Notebook.
The code needs to be reproducible. That means that all the data used in the essay need
to be available online (and ideally fetched directly from the notebook but a link to a
download page is also fine, although data manipulation outside of the Notebook is not
allowed) or shared as part of the submission. Any additional Python packages apart from
those available in the provided `sds` environment need to be explicitly specified on top
of the notebook. However, it is not expected that you will need it.

## Evalutation criteria

The essay is primarily evaluated on a percentage scale of 0-100. To successfully
complete the class, a minimum of 40% is required:

- [0-15]{.accent}: the code does not work and there is no documentation for it.
- [16-39]{.accent}: the code does not work or works but does not lead to the expected result. There
  is some documentation explaining its logic.
- [40-49]{.accent}: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is some documentation
  explaining its logic.
- [50-59]{.accent}: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive
  documentation explaining its logic.
- [60-69]{.accent}: the code runs and produces the expected output. There is extensive
  documentation, properly formatted, explaining its logic.
- [70-79]{.accent}: everything as above, plus the code design includes clear evidence of skills
  presented in advanced parts of the course (e.g., custom methods, list comprehension,
  etc.).
- [80-100]{.accent}: everything as above, plus the code includes new knowledge that
  extends/improves the functionality provided to the student (e.g., algorithm
  optimization, new methods to perform the task, etc.).

::: {.content-visible when-profile='sds4sg'}
The expected relationship between the score and a final mark (potential change will be
discussed ahead):

- [0-39]{.accent}: 4
- [40-49]{.accent}: 3
- [50-69]{.accent}: 2
- [70-100]{.accent}: 1
:::

The documentation should be formatted using Markdown syntax, not HTML.
