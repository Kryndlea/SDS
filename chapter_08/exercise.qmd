version will be released in October 2023.

Try to reproduce the similar with different population grids.

## WorlPop data of Kenya

Go to [wopr.worldpop.org](https://wopr.worldpop.org/) and download a _Gridded population estimates (~100m) for Kenya_ and a _Kenya 100m Building class_. Each is an archive, so unzip (reading from the zipped archive doesn't seem to work in this case.)

1. Load `KEN_population_v2_0_gridded.tif` and `KEN_building_class_metrics_v1_0_residential_count.tif` files.
2. Plot at least one of them in their full extent.
3. Clip them both to the extent of the `"Mombasa"` functional urban area from GHSL.
4. What is the maximum population per hectare in Mombasa?
4. Reproject one to match the other. These two grids are not perfectly aligned, so you need to align them. Check the tip below on how to do that.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Aligning rasters

When two rasters don't perfectly match (i.e. their resolution and placement are exactly
the same), you need to align them by projecting one to match the other.

Try figuring that out!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# A hint, please!

`rioxarray` has the functionality to do this as one line of code. Have you checked their (not so great, I admin) [documentation](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/index.html)?

:::  {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Another hint

You are looking for `.rio.reproject_match()` method.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Okay, here's the code

This is how the aligning should look.

```py
aligned_b = b.rio.reproject_match(a)
```

6. Normalise the population with the building count.
7. Save the result as a GeoTIFF.

# Optional extension

If you have time, you can also figure out how many buildings are per district in Mombasa. Those are in OpenStreetMap as admin_level==6.
