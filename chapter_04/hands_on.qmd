title: "Spatial weights in PySAL"
format: html
---

- `libpysal` and creation of various kinds of weights matrices and operations on them.
- spatial lag and its relationship to weight value and transformation method.

Need to figure out if I should teach current `W` or the new one from the `experimental`
namespace. Probably will have to stick to the current one as the rest of PySAL might not
work with the new one by October. Let's check with the PySAL team. Would be awesome to
teach the new class.
