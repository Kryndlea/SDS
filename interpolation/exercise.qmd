Going through this exercise is even more up to you than usual.

## Areal interpolation

Pick any dataset linked to polygon geometries used in previous chapters of the
course. Or any of your own, if you wish.

- Create a hexagonal grid of a reasonable [resolution](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable#cell-areas) covering the area of your data.
- Interpolate data to the grid. Make sure to use extensive and intensive variables correctly.
- Do you understand the difference in how the intensive variables are interpolated vs. the extensive?
- If you don't have a categorical column in your data, create one. Interpolate this categorical
  column to the grid. What is different when dealing with categorical data?

## Point interpolation

When dealing with point patterns, you [have worked](../point_patterns/exercise.qmd) with Airbnb listings in Prague.
Use the same data to interpolate the price of a single-bedroom flat to a hexagonal grid of resolution 10.

# Generating H3 polygons

You will need to pass a GeoSeries of polygons to the `h3fy` function. You can either get those
from the [Spatial weights](../spatial_graphs/hands_on.qmd) session or creating a GeoSeries on-the-fly.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Creating geometry on-the-fly

This would be one option:

```py
extent = gpd.GeoSeries([airbnb.union_all().convex_hull], crs=airbnb.crs)
```

# Data cleaning

Don't forget to remove outliers. Note that the price is now in CZK, not in GBP, as it
was in the case of Edinburgh.

- Play with different interpolation methods and try to understand the differences.
- Test how `KNeighborsRegressor` results differ when changing the number of neighbours.
- Do you understand the optimal parameters of Kriging?
- Can you figure out how to do Simple Kriging instead of Ordinary Kriging covered in the hands-on section?
